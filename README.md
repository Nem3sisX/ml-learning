# Machine Learning Exercises

explored Machine Learning and its Fundamentals in my freshman year at college and dabbled in pre-existing libraries.
  * created original algorithms and implemented them on original datasets wherever possible.
  * used scikitlearn and used existing libraries to implement learned theory.

1. Original Algorithms [here](https://github.com/Nem3sisX/ml-learning/tree/master/ml-learning/algorithms)  
2. sklearn algorithms and personal implementations of these algorithms [here](https://github.com/Nem3sisX/ml-learning/tree/master/ml-learning/learning-projects) 

Planning to foray deeper into ML as this Learning endeavor has piqued my interest in this field  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

  * install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual-environment.

### Installation

  * Clone this repository from [here](https://github.com/Nem3sisX/ml-learning.git).
  * Run programs using any preferred IDE. ( I used PyCharm Community Edition 2018.3.3 ) :P
  * If anything interesting pops up do let me know. :D

## Built With

  * [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Core Language
